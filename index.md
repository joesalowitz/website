## Hello, I'm <span style="color:green">Joe Salowitz</span>, CXO at Lead Scout. I've spent 15 years bringing products to market, both big and small.

Full /// Summary

Currently, Iâ€™m a co-founder and head of product at Lead Scout. I've spent 15 years designing and bringing products to market, both big and small.

At Lead Scout, my team and I raised pre-seed capital, launched a public beta month one, and generated $2M in revenue in the first 24 months of business with the goal to achieve true "product market fit", then raise further capital and scale. This story is not yet fully written...

_Lead Scout is a mobile lead generation app that enables home service contractors to get the most out of their sales team and self-generate their own leads._

As a co-founder at Lead Scout, I am intimately involved in the strategy, build out, sales, marketing and continued engagement of thousands of our home service customers. Beyond supporting the core product, I have led capital fundraising, scaled the marketing engine, managed the P&L and day-to-day operations. 

Formerly, I designed and scaled products for a wide range of clients from large-scale Fortune 100 and 500 companies like:

> _Oracle / Whirlpool / Landstar / Wyndham Worldwide / Houghton Mifflin Harcourt / Scholastic_

to cultural icons like 

> _Herman Miller / Capitol Records / University of Washington / Ace Hardware / Meijer_

and many other local businesses, nonprofits, and startups. 

I helped my clients as an *Independent Consultant* for over 5 years. Before going independent, I served as a *Senior UX Architect*, and eventually *Director of Experience Innovation*, at Universal Mind, a large digital service agency. 

This is where I really honed my craft as a UX/UI product designer, agile builder, and team leader. I spent my time working on insanely skilled product teams delivering the beauty of human-centered design and speed of agile (both fairly new concepts in the world of software at the time) to our clients. We helped many clients rollout agile at scale (via the SAFe framework). As Director, I had the opportunity to further evangelize our design approach through speaking, writing, and community engagement. 

In this time, I held a highly fulfilling role as Adjunct Instructor at Ferris State University, teaching a senior capstone in User Experience Strategy & Product Design - helping students get ready for the real world of product design!

I formed the basis of my skills in my roles prior to all that, building a user experience practice at an enterprise web agency, starting a small business that built exclusively responsive websites (at the onset of the mobile revolution), designing logos and marketing materials on the side, and learning raw HTML and CSS as a web production assistant at my local university.

My formal training was in business and graphic design - but in true keeping with many in the UX field, my degree was interdisciplinary and I've utilized every aspect of my varied schooling, from computer science, to civil engineering, to communications, to mathmetics in the products I've delivered.

Ultimately, I operate on a "speed to value" belief system. What is the fastest way teams can deliver value to the customer and start testing it? 

I've found the best products come out of an iterative but speedy delivery process where creators are enabled by executives to test a lot of ideas in the real world FAST, where cross-functional teams talk often and honestly, where prototypes are delivered fast and their shortcomings are identified and fixed even faster, and where user needs and context informs and drives everything from project KPIs to pixels to <p> tags.
